# Camploomis Web app

This is a personal project I've used to tool up and show case my work in next.js. Camploomis brewery was a dream of my cousin and I to start a brewery together when we started home brewing in college. We'd spent most of our childhood summers together at our grandmothers house in Loomis california, which our parents coined as Camploomis.
